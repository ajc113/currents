              Currents was born from the need for real time trustworthy fishing intel.  With the investment into sportfishing, boat cost, tackle, fuel and bait, targeting where the fish are will help eliminate searching to reduce time and fuel costs.  As technology enhances the sportfishing community has remained idle, stuck with old school traditions and dockside rumors.  Captains have limited networks to share information often by their homeport or geographical location, sometimes dealing with hearsay and outdated information.  Currents will provide its members real time intel, conditions, and trending to put you in the action.
